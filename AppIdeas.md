* Spilertool
    (Command line?) tool that displays spoilers for well known series and movies (GoT, Harry Potter, Star Wars) to the user [[data](https://winteriscoming.net/2018/12/31/every-spoiler-we-know-game-of-thrones-final-season-8/)]

* Strategier
    Tool for solving common problems (ISD, minmax Strategies, IWD/Nash for small matrices) on normal form games [using [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/)]

* Regequivalence
    Compares two regular expressions (that encode a regular language) on equivalence in their languages.
    Especially emptiness or the full set for finite languages may be interesting [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5058.pdf)]
